Challenges Faced
Throughout the development of this portfolio, I encountered several challenges that helped me grow both technically and creatively:

Implementing interactive "Read more" buttons using only CSS selectors, avoiding scripts
Ensuring animations and layouts adapt smoothly across different screen sizes (responsive design)

Selecting and harmonizing colors to maintain a clean yet attractive look without overwhelming the user
Keeping the design simple and organized while avoiding reliance on external libraries or frameworks
